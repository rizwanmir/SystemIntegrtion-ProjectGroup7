Introduction:

this is a documentation on Books API project which allows users to interact
with our RESTful API, to do things like for instance Adding new book/s to our existed library
, fetch a single book, fetch all books or update information on a single book
users allowed also to do the same process as mentioned above, which means that 
they can interact with more than books, in other words, Authors and Publishers entities.
